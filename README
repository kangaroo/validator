---------
Packaging
---------

Validator includes artifacts for creating debian packages. Packages can be
generated using the following steps.

1. To create a package from source, you'll first need to install a couple of
   developer utility packages:

    $ sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper

2. Clone source from git. Example:

    $ git clone https://github.com/zerovm/validator.git $HOME/validator

3. From the working copy, take a snapshot of the HEAD version of repo and save
   it to the parent directory (in this example, $HOME), then gzip it:

    $ cd $HOME/validator
    $ git archive HEAD --output ../libvalidator0_0.9.orig.tar
    $ gzip ../libvalidator0_0.9.orig.tar

4. Compile and build the package:

    $ debuild --source-option=--include-binaries

   To skip the prompt for a GPG signature, you can include these options:

    $ debuild -us -uc --source-option=--include-binaries

   This will output the following files in the parent directory ($HOME):

    libvalidator0_0.9-2_amd64.build
    libvalidator0_0.9-2_amd64.changes
    libvalidator0_0.9-2_amd64.deb
    libvalidator0_0.9-2.debian.tar.gz
    libvalidator0_0.9-2.dsc
